            Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are telltale signs or artifacts that suggest a potential security breach or malicious activity within a computer network or system. These indicators can include unusual network traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, abnormal system behaviors, or the presence of suspicious files, processes, or registry entries. IOCs are crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents, as they provide actionable intelligence that helps security teams identify, investigate, and mitigate potential threats.

        <p> By proactively monitoring for IOCs and correlating them with known threat intelligence sources, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture, strengthen incident response capabilities, and prevent or minimize the impact of cyber attacks.
