            Threat campaigns are orchestrated efforts by malicious actors, such as hackers, cybercriminal groups, or nation-state entities, to achieve specific objectives through coordinated attacks. These campaigns typically involve multiple stages and tactics aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to systems or data, and causing harm to individuals, organizations, or even entire nations. Whether driven by financial gain, espionage, political motives, or ideological beliefs, threat campaigns exhibit persistence, adaptability, and sophistication in their execution.
