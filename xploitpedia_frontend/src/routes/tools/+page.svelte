            Intrusion tools are software applications or scripts designed to facilitate unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. These tools are utilized by malicious actors, such as hackers, cybercriminals, or penetration testers, to exploit vulnerabilities, bypass security controls, and gain entry into target systems. Intrusion tools encompass a wide range of functionalities, including port scanning, vulnerability scanning, password cracking, network sniffing, and remote exploitation.

            While some intrusion tools are openly available for legitimate security testing and research purposes, others are developed and used for malicious intent, aiming to steal sensitive information, compromise systems for financial gain, or disrupt operations.
