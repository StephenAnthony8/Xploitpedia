            Threat groups, also known as cyber threat actors or malicious actors, are organized entities with the intent of conducting malicious activities in the digital realm. These groups can vary widely in their motivations, capabilities, and methods, ranging from financially motivated cybercriminal organizations to nation-state sponsored espionage operations. Threat groups often exhibit sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to achieve their objectives, which may include stealing sensitive information, disrupting critical services, conducting cyber espionage, spreading propaganda, or causing widespread damage.
